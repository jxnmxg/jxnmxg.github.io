    <h1>CompTIA Network+ Review</h1>

    <h2>Quick Info</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Official link:</strong> <a href="https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/network/" target="_blank">https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/network/</a></li>
        <li><strong>Study Time:</strong> ~ 1 month (I didn't take it seriously until 1 week before the exam.)</li>
        <li><strong>Exam Time:</strong> 90 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Exam Price:</strong> $349 (I used Messer's discount)</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> 3/10 (It's way easier than what people say online)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Background Info</h2>
    <p>
        I do have my Security+ so that made the network security section so much easier. I did not really have to study for that part at all.
    </p>

    <h2>Study Materials</h2>
    <p>
        I used Dion's practice exams, Exam Compass, and CertDoctor's Udemy course. If you don't want to pay for a course, then Professor Messer's free course on YouTube is fine too.
        These are the only resources I recommend. For the practice exams, make sure you understand what you are getting wrong. I used ChatGPT to help explain the questions and why I got them wrong.
        I was scoring 80%+ on the exams in the final week of studying. Also, try not to take the same practice exams repeatedly so you don't start memorizing the answers.
    </p>

    <h2>Exam Tips</h2>
    <p>
        As for all CompTIA tests, skip the PBQs and do the normal questions first. I also recommend taking the test at a test center. They'll give you a piece of paper to use during the test.
        I recommend writing anything you may forget on the paper once your test begins.
    </p>

    <h2>Exam Review</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, the test was not really that difficult. I felt that the Sec+ was a bit harder. I can't say much about the content, but just make sure you know your subnetting and the port numbers that are on the exam objectives.
        Do not leave any question blank—take a guess at least. You don't lose any points for guessing.
        If you're taking the test at a test center, then you will know if you passed or not. If you failed, then on the score sheet, you will see the domains where you got questions wrong (but not the exact questions). Use that information to fine-tune your knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        I suggest just sticking to the resources below. Recently, with ChatGPT, there has been a lot of garbage put out that isn't all that great.
        Also, you may see people saying, “Get your *insert random CompTIA cert* and you're golden. You will get a job in no time.” That really isn't the case.
        The Net+ will help, but just because you have it doesn't mean jobs will be fighting for you to join them.
        I plan on getting my CCNA next since there is some material overlap between it and the Net+.
    </p>
