    <h1>TCM Security's PHDA (Practical Help Desk Associate) Review</h1>
    <p><strong>Official link:</strong> <a href="https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/phda/" target="_blank">https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/phda/</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Study time:</strong> ~10 hours (I just did the free course at 1.5x speed)</li>
        <li><strong>Exam time:</strong> 8 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> $199 (no other materials needed)</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> 1/10 (if you already have a basic understanding of IT)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Study Materials</h2>
    <p>
        I recommend going through the free help desk course TCM offers. 
        Make sure you understand the topics covered in the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-help-desk" target="_blank"> free course</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Free Course Review</h3>
    <p>
        The free course covers a wide range of topics you’d need to know for a help desk role. 
        While it doesn’t go super deep into each subject, it gives you a solid overall understanding. 
        It includes hands-on activities like setting up an Active Directory environment. 
        Just a heads-up: have a decent computer since you’ll be running multiple virtual machines. 
        I highly suggest you take this course even if you don’t plan on taking the PHDA — 
        it’s a great intro to the fundamentals.
    </p>

    <h2>Exam Experience</h2>
    <p>
        The most important tip I can give: <strong>READ THE EXAM TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong> 
        I didn’t, and ended up going back to grab extra screenshots. Also, 
        make sure you have OpenVPN installed and ready before the exam starts, 
        so you don’t waste precious time setting it up.
    </p>

    <h2>Exam Review</h2>
    <p>
        The exam does a very good job of simulating a chill help desk workday. 
        The 8 hours provided is more than enough to solve the tickets and write the report. 
        Again: <strong>READ the exam terms and tickets carefully</strong>. 
        It’s an open-book exam, so you can refer back to the course if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exam costs $199 and includes a free retake. 
        Overall, I think it’s worth it — especially if you're starting out in tech.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
